# component-base
AAM和类AAM API对象的 Scheme、Type、Encode、Decode和 Conversion Packages

## Purpose

This library is a shared dependency for servers and clients to work with AAM API infrastructure without direct
type dependencies. Its first consumers are `github.com/khh403/component-base`, `github.com/khh403/khh403-sdk-go`.


## Compatibility

There are *NO compatibility guarantees* for this repository. It is in direct support of AAM, so branches
will track AAM and be compatible with that repo. As we more cleanly separate the layers, we will review the
compatibility guarantee.
